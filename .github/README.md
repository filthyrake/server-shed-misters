# GitHub Copilot Configuration

This directory contains configuration files for GitHub Copilot coding agent to help it understand and work with this repository effectively.

## Files

### `copilot-instructions.md`
Main instructions file that provides Copilot with:
- Project overview and context
- Development workflow and commands
- Architecture and design patterns
- Critical implementation details
- Safety guidelines for hardware control
- Testing and deployment procedures

This file is automatically loaded by Copilot when working on issues in this repository.

### `agents/` Directory
Contains custom agent profiles for specialized tasks:

#### `hardware-safety-agent.md`
Specialized agent for ensuring safety when modifying code that controls physical hardware (water valves and sensors). Use this agent when:
- Modifying misting decision logic
- Changing state management
- Updating emergency stop or cooldown mechanisms
- Reviewing changes that affect valve control

#### `api-integration-agent.md`
Specialized agent for working with SwitchBot and Rachio APIs. Use this agent when:
- Adding or modifying API endpoints
- Changing authentication patterns
- Updating device discovery logic
- Handling temperature conversion (Celsius â†” Fahrenheit)
- Troubleshooting API connectivity issues

#### `docker-deployment-agent.md`
Specialized agent for Docker configuration and deployment. Use this agent when:
- Modifying Docker Compose files
- Updating Dockerfile
- Changing deployment scripts
- Configuring systemd service
- Setting up production environments
- Troubleshooting deployment issues

## Usage

### For GitHub Copilot Coding Agent
When you assign an issue to Copilot:
1. Copilot automatically loads `copilot-instructions.md`
2. For specialized tasks, mention the appropriate agent in the issue description
3. Agents provide focused expertise for their specific domains

### For Custom Agents
To invoke a custom agent, reference it in your issue or PR comments:
```
@copilot use hardware-safety-agent to review this change
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Instructions Updated**: When making significant architectural changes, update `copilot-instructions.md`
2. **Use Specialized Agents**: Leverage custom agents for domain-specific tasks
3. **Safety First**: Always use `hardware-safety-agent` for changes affecting physical hardware control
4. **Clear Issues**: Write detailed issue descriptions to help Copilot understand context
5. **Review Changes**: Always review Copilot's PRs before merging, especially for safety-critical code
